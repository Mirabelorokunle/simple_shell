A Shell is a program that takes the command inputs written from the the userâ€™s keyboard and passes them to the machine to execute them through the kernel. It also verifies if the command inputs from the user are correct.  Every shell has two operating modes:

Interactive and Non-interactive.

In Interactive mode, the shell displays a prompt ($) indicating that the user can write and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt will appear again as wait for a new command. This can go indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the shell.

In Non-interactive mode, the shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is run as soon as the Shell starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from the user.

This project consists of a basic command interpreter (Shell) created in C language with several features;
1: Write the main code of the shell.
2: Write shell functions for checking and executing built ins.
3: Write shell functions for checking the input and obtaining parameters.
4: Write shell functions for operating strings.
5: Write shell functions for handling errors.
6: Write  a shell function for executing commands.
7: Write a Header file to connect all functions
8: Create a manual page for simpleshell
